There are a few things you can try to change the mood of an angry cat:
1)Give them space.
2)Provide them with toys.
3)Give them attention.
4 Give them a clean environment and regular grooming.
5)Give them a proper diet.
6)Try to identify and remove triggers.

It's important to note that some cats may have underlying health issues or behavioral problems that can cause them to be more prone to anger. If you are unable to change the mood of your cat despite trying these methods, it may be best to consult with a veterinarian or a professional cat behaviorist for additional help
It's important to keep in mind that each cat is unique and what works for one may not work for another. It's also important to be patient and not to use physical punishment or harsh punishment.
