If your cat is in a relaxed mood and you would like to change it, here are a few things you can try:

1)Introduce new toys.
2)Playtime.
3)Provide a stimulating environment.
4)Give them a treat.
5)Give them a grooming session.
6)Give them a small challenge.


If you are unable to change the mood of your cat despite trying these methods, it may be best to consult with a veterinarian or a professional cat behaviorist for additional help.
It's important to keep in mind that each cat is unique and what works for one may not work for another. It's also important to be patient and not to use physical punishment or harsh punishmet.
